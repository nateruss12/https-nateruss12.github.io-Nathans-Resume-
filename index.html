            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I had my first opportunity to learn coding in highschool.
                I was able to make a 1 page website using basic HTML in notepad.
                My website was about sneakers and fashion.
                My second opportunity for learning coding and programming came with Year UP.
                I will have coded an email signature, which I can modify as titles and companies and titles change ,
                a website resume and will have also successfully made a 3-7 page website as well.</p>
